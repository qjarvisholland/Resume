Quinn JH engineer resume
=========================
Hi! This is the source repo for my most recent resume, which is the .pdf file in this repo above :)
Below is the information about the template I forked to bring some order to my chaos.

Deedy-Resume-Reversed
=========================

A **one-page**, **two asymmetric column** resume template in **XeTeX** that caters particularly to an **undergraduate Computer Science** student.
1. **OpenFonts** - uses free, open-source fonts that resemble the above - *Lato* (and its various variants) and *Raleway*.

It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

## Motivation

This is a modified fork of the [Deedy-Resume by Deedy](https://github.com/Deedy/Deedy-Resume) 

## Dependencies

1. Compiles only with **XeTeX** and required **BibTex** for compiling publications and the .bib filetype.

## Known Issues:
1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the vertical limit
2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.
